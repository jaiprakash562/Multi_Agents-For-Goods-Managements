# Multi_Agents-For-Goods-Managements
Ai Agents through build this one
This system uses four agents Customer,Inventory,Supplier,and Delivery to manage goods automatically.
When a customer places an order,the Inventory Agent checks stock.
If stock is low,the Supplier Agent restocks it.
Once stock is available,the Inventory Agent approves the order,and the Delivery Agent delivers the goods to the customer.
Each agent handles its own job,communicates with others and works together to complete the order smoothly.
